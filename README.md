#  Frontend Challenge

Thank you for taking the time to do our front-end challenge!

We expect that this assignment will take ~3 hours to complete.

##  Instructions

You will be building a React App. We have provided the boilerplate application as a starting point. Please build on top of this.

The React App is A Pokédex using data from the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/), a Pokédex is a Pokémon catalogue/indexer, where you can search and find details about Pokémons.

You should check your solution in here while making commits at logical increments. We’re interested in how your solution developed, not just the end result.

**Please implement the following features**

- fetch data from the API and render in a table with the following columns: sprite, name, moves, types
  - you're welcome to add other columns if you like
- populate the table with at least 30 Pokemon (i.e. the table should have at least 30 rows)
- implement table results filter (local only), filtering by pokemon name is enough

**Nice to have**

- tailwind css
- swr/react-query

[1] Our project uses tailwind css, because of that this repo comes with the tailwind css setup and you can use it if you want but this is not mandatory.
[2] the project uses Vite, if for some reason you find problems, you're more than welcome to use create-react-app or another tool of your preference.

## What are we looking to see in this test

- we will evaluate how you write and structure your code
- you can use libraries, or write your own table from scratch, it's up to you but writing your own table can give you bonus points
- we want to see your core JS and React skills
- advanced react concepts can give you extra points
